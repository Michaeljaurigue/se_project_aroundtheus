Welcome to the Around The U.S Project! This project is the culmination of all the incredible skills and knowledge that I gained during my time learning HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING, RESPONSIVE DESIGN, AND ASYNCHRONOUS API'S at Practicum.com.

As a web developer, I had the privilege of utilizing cutting-edge technologies and techniques such as API integration, asynchronous code, object-oriented programming, and responsive web design.

One of the most exciting features of this project is the seamless user experience that was carefully crafted to ensure that users have a smooth and enjoyable time while navigating the website. The use of classes such as "FormValidator" and "Card" enabled me to create a site that is not only beautiful but also functional.

To ensure that the site runs smoothly, I implemented methods such as fetch(), then(), and Promise, when interfacing with the API. Additionally, I utilized loops and templates, as well as optimized images, to ensure fast load times and a high level of performance.

Furthermore, the use of flexbox and grid layout, along with media queries, ensured that the website is fully responsive and looks fantastic on any device. To enhance the user experience, I implemented custom error messages and styling, dynamic form validation, and even a "Saving..." feature that lets users know that their data is being communicated to/from the server.

Overall, this project was an incredibly rewarding experience that allowed me to utilize my knowledge of JavaScript, object-oriented programming, and responsive web design to create a beautiful and functional website. I am excited to share this project with the world, and I hope you enjoy exploring it as much as I enjoyed creating it!
